        "\n",
        "An implementation of [named tensors](https://namedtensor.github.io) with the functionality of [einsum](http://einops.rocks]http://einops.rocks) , batching ([vmap](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#vectorization-vmap), [xmap](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/xmap_tutorial.html)), and tensor indexing by adding dimension objects to PyTorch_.\n",
        "\n",
        "The tensor input to a resnet might have the shape [8, 3, 224, 224] but informally we think of those dimensions as 'batch', 'channel', 'width', and 'height'. Eventhough 'width' and 'height' have the same _size_ we still think of them as separate dimensions, and if we have two _different_ images, we think of both as sharing the _same_ 'channel' dimension.\n",
        "\n",
        " Instead of treating this concept informally, named tensors gives these dimensions names. Instead of using strings to name dimensions like [PyTorch's current implementation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/named_tensor.html), this library introduces a Python object, a `Dim`, to represent the concept. By expanding the semantics of tensors with dim objects, in addition to naming dimensions, we can get behavior equivalent to batching transforms (xmap, vmap), einops-style rearragement, and loop-style tensor indexing.\n",

Even unbinding is just the `permute` operator which follows from Rule #2, though we call it `order` for clarity.

For large sized tensors, the performance of any statements including them will be the same as using the already existing operations. An important exception is the pattern matching of products and summation, where performance will be improved by issuing to a matrix-multiply kernel. The C++ implementation of dimensions adds a small overhead of around 2us on top of PyTorch's normal overhead of 8us to each function that uses them. In the future, the implementation can encorporate more fusion optimization to further improve performance of this style of code."
