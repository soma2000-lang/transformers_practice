In this case, we wouldn't want to force activations across the batch to fit the same distribution - we may want certain neurons to in fact be more or less active at different time steps.\n","\n","This motivated the creation of a solution to internal covariate shift compatible with RNNs, which means it could not normalize across batches.\n","\n","### Intuition\n","\n","Instead, Layer Normalization (intuitively) normalizes activations across all the neurons in a layer, rather than normalizing activations of a single neuron across batches.\n","\n","This has the effect of still ensuring that the inputs to neurons in the next layer (weighted sums of the activations of the previous layer) came from the same normalized distribution, even as the magnitude of activations of neurons in the previous layer with respect to each other may change.\n","\n","Importantly, this method of normalization does not force neurons to model a predictable distribution across a batch of training data, allowing neurons in sequence modeling to effectively learn representations specific to different time steps.\n","\n","### Math\n","\n","The actual implementation of this normalization is very similar to batch normalization, except across the layer. The final function for the activations of each layer is as follows:\n","\n","$$h_i = f(\\frac{g_i}{\\sigma_i}(a_i - \\mu_i) + b_i)$$\n","\n","Where $f$ is the activation function, $\\mu_i$ and $\\sigma_i$ are the tuned mean and variance for the distributions, $g_i$ is the gain added to the normalized values of each activation, and $b_i$ is the bias for each neuron."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"U9-Cdwo6VAOQ"},"source":["# My Notes\n","\n","## 📜 [Layer Normalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.06450)\n","\n","> The effect of batch normalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to apply it to recurrent neural networks.\n","\n","> Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs exactly the same computation at training and test times.\n","\n","> It is also straightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the normalization statistics separately at each time step.\n","\n","> It is possible to speed-up the learning by computing gradients for different subsets of the training cases on different machines or splitting the neural network itself over many machines.\n","\n","> An orthogonal approach is to modify the computations performed in\n","> the forward pass of the neural net to make learning easier.\n","\n","Work hard vs. work smart. You can throw more compute at your current architecture, but you can also improve your architecture to make training more efficient.
